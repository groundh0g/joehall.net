[Word Nerd!](https://joehall.net/game-test/) has been updated to reflect the great input that I've received from the early adopters.

### Version 1.3.0, 04Apr2023

- adds save settings
- adds save analytics on game over
- adds analytics review screen
- adds button to reset statistics
- adds tweaks to mobile styling to support more phones
- adds game code validation, when code is provided
- adds easier sharing of game code via web link
- menu item to reset settings to defaults
- adds tweaks to mobile styling to support more phones
- adds player rankings from 'Newbie' to 'Word Nerd'
- adds lots of visual bells and whistles

**Known Issues**

- easy, easier, easiest dictionaries need curating
- dates on heat map aren't synced with today
- not all menu items are implemented

Word Nerd was designed mobile-first, so it should work well on phone and desktop. There are even desktop applications for Windows and MacOS (not yet released).
