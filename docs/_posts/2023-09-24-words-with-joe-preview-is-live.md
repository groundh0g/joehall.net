[Words with Joe (Preview)](https://games.joehall.net/wordswithjoe/) has been released.

### Version 0.1.0, 24Sep2023

- feature complete (minus AI)

**Known Issues**

- missing CPU opponent
- missing final polish (menus, analytics, settings, ...)

Words with Joe was designed mobile-first, so it should work well on phone and desktop. There are even desktop applications for Windows and MacOS (not yet released).

> **NOTE:** Touch is not enabled in this release, so mobile isn't playable just yet. It just renders as expected.
