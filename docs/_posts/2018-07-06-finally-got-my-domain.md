title:  "I Finally Got My Domain!"

I've been waiting for 20 years to land a top-level domain for "joehall". For all this time, `joehall.com` has been a construction company that specializes in gas stations, `joehall.org` has been a canadian band, and `joehall.net` has been an insurance agent. To make it all a bit stranger, I've lived within 15 miles of two of those domain holders.

Well, all that waiting has finally paid off. As you can tell (by looking at the current URL), the `joehall.net` domain became available and I was able to grab it. So, now I live within 15 centimeters of one of the domain holders.

This space will replace <http://moreoncode.com/> as my primary domain. Most of that content is generic fluff, but the part that I try to maintain is the [#gamedev summer camps](http://moreoncode.com/camps/).
