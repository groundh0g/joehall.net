Since 2011, I've taught a game programming camp for high school kids every summer. You can see the previous students and their projects at <http://moreoncode.com/camps/>.

The 2018 camp was a lot of fun. I never know what the game will be ahead of time. That's driven completely by the students. This go around, they made a variation of the classic Connect Four game, complete with exploding pieces (and several other power-ups).

I'll post more details (and the gameplay video) on the `moreoncode.com` site sometime soon.
