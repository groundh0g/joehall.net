While I've been waiting for one of the `joehall[.com|.net|.org]` domains to open up, I've had another lofty goal... I want to create a website for my kids.

I've had the domain for a while now, but haven't done anything with it. It was a domain that a buddy of mine intended to create a naughty site, but he never did - which is fortunate, since that means it hasn't been listed on any filter blacklists. That was the only time I've ever paid for a domain name (beyond the typical registration fees).

What's the domain? I'm glad you asked! It's `girlsatplay.com`. There's not much there now. It's a placeholder that has very little resemblance to my vision for it.

I plan to take my foot off the breaks soon. My youngest has expressed an interest in learning my trade. And my middle kid has asked to have me teach her a programming class this coming semester. (We've home-schooled all three girls.)

The eldest has landed on a career path that involves pets and pet health. She's 18 now, and landed her first job a few weeks ago. That job is in an unrelated field, but it's a great first step into adulthood, and I've very proud of her for taking that step.
