I didn't realize how long it had been since my last post to this site. I've had some health issues, but I've been plugging away at my hobby code the whole time. I need to get some of that work wrapped up so I can show it off here.

This morning, I made a personal logo for myself. I've designed plenty of logos for my sites and projects, but I've only ever done avatars for my social media presence, family, and friends. I hope you like it. The idea was loosely inspired by the macOS icon, and spurred on by an interaction with a waiter at the local Thai restaurant.

I have 4 or 5 active projects I'm juggling now, but when I'm done pushing this post to the blog, I'll be returning to my work on <http://gamedevutils.com/>. It's a massive rewrite, but I've made some good progress.
