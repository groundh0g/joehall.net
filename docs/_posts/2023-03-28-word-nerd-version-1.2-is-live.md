[Word Nerd!](https://joehall.net/game-test/) has been updated to reflect the great input that I've received from the early adopters.

**Version 1.2.0, 28Mar2023**

- adds game menu [draft]
- adds toaster notification for share button
- adds tile animations
- adds colors for special keyboard keys
- adds 4-state keyboard highlighting
- adds nerd glasses to avatars
- adds minor content updates

Word Nerd was designed mobile-first, so it should work well on phone and desktop. There are even desktop applications for Windows and MacOS (not yet released).
