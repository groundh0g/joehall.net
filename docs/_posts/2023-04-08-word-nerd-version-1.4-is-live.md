[Word Nerd!](https://games.joehall.net/wordnerd/) has been updated to reflect the great input that I've received from the early adopters. And it has been moved to it's new "forever" home.

### Version 1.4.3, 12Apr2023

- adds fixes for highlighting yellow/green tiles
- adds word definiton to game over screen
- adds analytics reset to menu
- adds fixes for heat map on analytics screen
- adds several bug fixes
- adds logic to mimic Wordle's tile indicators for duplicate letters
- adds two new lifelines
  1. undo last guess (single-use per game)
  2. reveal letter (single-use per game)

**Known Issues**

- easy, easier, easiest dictionaries need curating
- no real intro / tutorial process for new players

Word Nerd was designed mobile-first, so it should work well on phone and desktop. There are even desktop applications for Windows and MacOS (not yet released).
